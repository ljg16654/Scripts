#+title: README

This is a collection of scripts written for my windows manager to
incorporate with Dmenu, Emacs, Alacritty and Qutebrowser.  Currently
I'm using BSPWM, so most of them utilize =bspc= to obtain information
about windows and desktops. The scripts that do not require command
line arguments are usually bound to keys with =sxhd=.
